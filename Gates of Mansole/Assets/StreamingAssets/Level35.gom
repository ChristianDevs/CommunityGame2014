        Speaker:Lieutenant Captain
        LeftImage:10
        RightImage:None
        Dialogue:Prince, about Kign Diabolus, but perhaps he was so overcome by his conviction.
    Statement:
        Speaker:Lieutenant Captain
        LeftImage:10
        RightImage:None
        Dialogue:His concern for everyone is evident. Perhaps he tried to make changes and had no alternative.
    Statement:
        Speaker:Prince Emmanuel
        LeftImage:None
        RightImage:17
        Dialogue:That idea is preposterous. We questioned him fully and concluded that his conviction was only self-interest.
